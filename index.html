                <p>Wild Metaverse Token is inspired by world Wildlife Foundation. Wildlife is a precious gift from God
                    for this planet. The term "fauna" is not only for wild
                    animals but also for all non-domesticated life forms including birds, insects, plants, fungi and
                    even microscopic organisms. To maintain a healthy ecological balance on this land, animals, plants
                    and marine species are as important as humans.
                    Every organism on this earth has a unique place in the food chain that | contributes to the
                    ecosystem in its own way. But, unfortunately today, many
                    animals and birds are endangered. </p>

                <p>Natural habitats of animals and plants are destroyed for land development and agriculture by humans.
                    Poaching and hunting of animals for fur, jewellery, meat and leather are other important factors
                    contributing to the extinction of wildlife. If soon, no rigorous measures are taken to save the
                    fauna, it would not be long
                    when they find a place on the list of extinct species. And that would not be all! The extinction of
                    wild species will certainly have a fatal impact on the human
                    race. So, for us as human beings, it becomes a great responsibility to save the wildlife, our planet
                    and most importantly, ourselves. Here are some other reasons
                    for deep understanding why wildlife plays such an important role in maintaining an ecological
                    balance on Earth.</p>

                <p>Our NFTS is inspired by wildlife.</p>

        <h1>WHY WILD METAVERSE TOKEN</h1>

        <div class="why_wmt_container">
            <div class="why_wmt_content">
                <p>We Pancakeswap as a start-up platform; you are investing in our vision; long-term we want to switch
                    to a revenue model from the NFT Marketplace, We recognise for future growth it will be beneficial
                    for the native token to remove taxes; as this will be a requirement for bigger exchange listings.
                    See the starting tax as a means to establish the token; long-term the real value is getting our name
                    out there to the masses; and having our brand develop and evolve into the number one NFT
                    marketplace.</p>

                <p>There are informal partnerships already in talks with other coins, we believe in working in
                    partnership rather than competition. The partnerships will be centered around benefits for both
                    communities and be with “SAFU" teams.This will mean a certain level of transparency and security
                    such as audit, We will focus on working together strategically to benefit both communities and
                    ultimately achieve visibility by hosting Ask-Me-Anything (AMAs), Twitter promotion, NFT
                    cross-promotion etc.</p>

                <p>We are also reserving 10% of the supply for exchange listings: </p>

                <p>we aim to first list on a big Asian Exchange; and then progress to other exchange listings. A big
                    focus of our marketing will be the Asian market as we value their investment; we believe in
                    respecting cultural differences, but also working together to build a strong community, a strong
                    vision and strong brand. All this will require work from all of our communities. This is why we have
                    formed the international board of directors alliance; all of our communities will be heard and we
                    will work with you; you are investing in our business; view yourselves as shareholders who have an
                    input into the direction and decision-making. We will be hosting regular-AMAs in all our growing
                    number of International communities. Our aim is to have quarterly reports that highlight what has
                    gone well, the lessons learnt, feedback from the community and where our development and marketing
                    focus has been and will be upcoming. For this we will host meetings on Zoom or Telegram (depending
                    on quality), and give you the information to make informed decisions about your financial
                    investments.</p>
